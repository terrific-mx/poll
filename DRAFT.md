Terrific Poll is a service that allows you to create polls easily embedded in newsletters using any email newsletter service.

Even if your newsletter service doesn't support polls, it may require a plan upgrade or a paid add-on.

First, you create a poll by assigning it an internal name, writing the question, and adding up to 10 response options.

You can then copy the poll for easy embedding in services like Beehiiv, Brevo, EmailOctopus, Ghost, HubSpot, Kit, Loops, MailerLite, and Sendy.

The copied poll includes your question and links to the response options. When your recipient clicks on a response option, it opens a page to confirm their selection. It pre-fills the contact email using your newsletter service's merge tags and submits their response.

Once you start collecting responses, your poll dashboard will display the number of responses received and a percentage indicator for each response option. You can also access a detailed table showing the responses for each option, along with the date of the response and the contact email (if provided) of the person who submitted it.

## What it does

Terrific Poll is a service that allows users to easily create and embed polls in email of which newsletters, regardless of which newsletter service they use.

- Create Polls: Users can create a poll by giving it an internal name, writing a question, and adding up to 10 response options.
- Embed in Newsletters: The service generates poll content that can be embedded in popular newsletter plattorms (e.g., Beenliv, Brevo, Emailoctopus, Ghost, Hubspot, Kit, Loops, MallerLite, sendy), even if those platforms don't natively support polls.
- Easy Response Collection: Each poll option is a link. When a recipient clicks a response, they're taken to a confirmation page where their selection is pre-filled (using the newsletter service's merge tags for contact email) and submitted.

    - The number of responses for each option

## Objection-handling statements

1. Deliverability & Spam Concerns
   - "Will adding poll links affect my email deliverability or increase the chance of my emails being marked as spam?"

**Response:** Terrific Poll uses standard, reputable link formats that are compatible with all major email providers. Our links are designed to avoid common spam triggers, and we never include attachments or suspicious redirects. As with any email, following best practices—such as using a verified sending domain and avoiding excessive links—will help maintain high deliverability.

2. Privacy & Data Security
   - "How is my audience's data (especially email addresses) handled and protected?"
   - "Is Terrific Poll GDPR/compliance-friendly?"

**Response:** We take privacy and data security seriously. All data, including email addresses, is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell or share your audience’s information with third parties. Terrific Poll is designed with GDPR and other privacy regulations in mind, and we provide tools to help you manage, export, or delete data as needed.

3. Branding & Customization
   - "Can I customize the look and feel of the poll and confirmation page to match my brand?"
   - "Will my subscribers see Terrific Poll branding instead of my own?"

**Response:** At this time, the confirmation page cannot be customized with your brand’s colors, logo, or messaging. However, Terrific Poll does not display any visible Terrific Poll branding to your subscribers—the only reference is the domain name in the web browser’s address bar. The
experience is kept clean and neutral, so your audience’s focus remains on your poll question and options.

4. User Experience
   - "Will my subscribers find it confusing to click a link and be taken to a separate confirmation page?"
   - "Is the process seamless, or does it add friction?"

**Response:** The process is designed to be as simple as possible: one click takes the subscriber to a clear confirmation page where their choice is pre-filled. This extra step helps votes and gives users a chance to confirm their selection, improving data quality without adding confusion.

5. Integration Limitations
   - "Does it work with my specific newsletter platform and merge tags?"
   - "What if my platform doesn't support merge tags or has limited support?"

**Response:** Terrific Poll is compatible with all major newsletter platforms and supports a wide range of merge tags for pre-filling subscriber information. If your platform has limited merge tag support, the poll will still function—recipients can manually enter their email if needed. We provide detailed guides for the most popular platforms and are happy to help with custom
setups.

6. Response Tracking Accuracy
   - "How accurate is the response tracking, especially if people forward emails or click links multiple times?"
   - "Can people vote more than once?"

**Response:** Each response is tracked individually, and we use email addresses (when available) to help prevent duplicate votes. While forwarding emails can allow multiple responses from the same link, our dashboard highlights potential duplicates so you can review them. For most use cases, this provides a reliable and accurate picture of your audience’s preferences.

7. Cost & Value
   - "Is it worth paying for this service when some platforms offer basic polls for free or as a paid add-on?"
   - "Are there hidden costs or limitations?"

**Response:** Terrific Poll offers universal compatibility, advanced analytics, and customization that most built-in or add-on poll features can’t match. There are no hidden fees—our pricing is transparent, and you get full access to all features. For many users, the time saved and increased engagement more than justify the investment.

8. Technical Support & Reliability
   - "What if something goes wrong-how quickly can I get support?"
   - "Is the service reliable and always available?"

**Response:** We offer responsive customer support via email and chat, with most issues resolved within one business day. Our infrastructure is built for reliability, with high uptime and regular monitoring to ensure your polls are always available.

9. Data Ownership & Export
   - "Can I export my poll results and data easily?"
   - "Do I retain ownership of my data?"

**Response:** Absolutely. You can export your poll results at any time in CSV format. You always retain full ownership of your data, and we never use it for any purpose other than providing the service to you.

10. Accessibility
    - “Are the poll links and confirmation pages accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies?”

**Response:** Accessibility is a priority for us. Our poll links and confirmation pages are designed to meet modern accessibility standards (such as WCAG), ensuring that all users—including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies—can participate without barriers.

## Market Maturity: New/Emerging

The overall email marketing market is mature, but the specific niche of universal, embeddable, no-code polling for newsletters is new and emerging. There is clear demand, but the space is not yet crowded or saturated.

## Customer Awareness Stage: Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware

- Problem-Aware:
    Most potential customers (newsletter creators, marketers, etc.) are aware that:
    - They want to engage their audience more.
    - Their current newsletter platform doesn’t support polls, or only does so with limitations or extra cost.
    - They may have tried workarounds (like Google Forms) but found them clunky or not well-integrated.
- Solution-Aware:
    Some customers may know that “email poll” tools exist, but:
    - They may not know a universal, easy, no-code solution is available.
    - They may not be aware of Terrific Poll specifically.
    - They may not realize how seamless and platform-agnostic a solution can be.
- Not Yet Product-Aware:
    Most of the target audience likely does not know Terrific Poll by name or its unique benefits, unless they’ve specifically searched for this kind of tool.

Terrific Poll’s audience is mostly problem-aware and solution-aware—they know they want to add polls to emails and may know some solutions exist, but are not yet familiar with Terrific Poll as the best or easiest option.
