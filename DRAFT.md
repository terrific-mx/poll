Terrific Poll is a service that allows you to create polls easily embedded in newsletters using any email newsletter service.

Even if your newsletter service doesn't support polls, it may require a plan upgrade or a paid add-on.

First, you create a poll by assigning it an internal name, writing the question, and adding up to 10 response options.

You can then copy the poll for easy embedding in services like Beehiiv, Brevo, EmailOctopus, Ghost, HubSpot, Kit, Loops, MailerLite, and Sendy.

The copied poll includes your question and links to the response options. When your recipient clicks on a response option, it opens a page to confirm their selection. It pre-fills the contact email using your newsletter service's merge tags and submits their response.

Once you start collecting responses, your poll dashboard will display the number of responses received and a percentage indicator for each response option. You can also access a detailed table showing the responses for each option, along with the date of the response and the contact email (if provided) of the person who submitted it.
